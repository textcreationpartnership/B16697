            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE Garbling Office Of the CITY Of LONDON. <hi>To all</hi> MERCHANTS <hi>and others whom it may Concern,</hi> 1679.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS the said Office is grounded upon several Acts of Parliament, and hath been found to be very useful for preventing many abuses in the Sale of Corrupt and mingled Spices, Drugs and other Merchandizes, and consequently for the Safety of His Majesties Person and Subjects, who daily use the same both in their Food and Physick; and also for preventing many Controversies between the Buyers and Sellers: Yet notwithstanding of late, contrary to the true meaning of the said Acts, the Buyers and Sellers of these Commodities, have fallen upon new Devices in their private Bargains for their private gain, by their Clandestine practice of Covering and Concealing Freemen and Forreigners Goods, hindering and preventing the Garbler appointed by the City from the due Execution of the said Office according to his Oath at his Admittance.</p>
            <p>THerefore these are to give Notice and Advertisement to all Merchants and Importers of Goods whatsoever, that they do not sell nor deliver any Spices, Druggs, Wares or Merchandizes Garblable, untill they be first sufficiently Garbled and Cleansed, and Sealed with the Seal of the said Office, under the Penalties mentioned in the Act of Parliament, which is the Forfeiture of the whole Goods so Sold; and that all Transgressors and Offendors herein will be Impartially and without Respect of Persons, proceeded against according to Law in his Majesties Court of Exchequer.</p>
            <p>And to you Gentlemen that are Shop-keepers and Ware-house-keepers, Retailers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptioners whatsoever, of the said Goods Garblable; Ye are to take notice that ye do not Cover nor Conceal Freemen nor Forreigners Goods, to the dammage and hinderance of the due Execution of the said Office, according to ancient Custom, least those that are found to do so, be found guilty of the breach of their Oaths as Freemen. The said Office belonging to the City and is a part of her Immunities which every Freeman is Sworn to preserve.</p>
            <p>And this is to give the like Warning to some of you that exercise in the way of Broakers, by experience being found to be guilty of this also, in that for Facilitateing the bargaine to your own gain, you suffer the Merchant to slip into the breach of a known Law, by not discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Seller the truth of his Danger.</p>
            <p>In Fine, it is purposed to call upon all such persons as have goods in their Shops, Cellars or Warehouses, that the same may be Garbled, which if denyed and found Ungarbled, the Person so Transgressing will be proceeded against according to the true meaning of the Act for Garbling. And that hereafter none may plead Ignorance, it hath been thought fit to give this Friendly Advertisement.</p>
            <p>The Office is kept at the House of Mr. <hi>James Donalson</hi> in <hi>Rood-Lane,</hi> where there are fit Persons, and well qualified, to attend the said Work; and are upon their Oaths to deal justly and uprightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man.</p>
